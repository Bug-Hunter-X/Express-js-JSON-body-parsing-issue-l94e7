This repository contains a bug report and solution for an issue encountered when parsing JSON request bodies in an Express.js application. The bug manifests as an empty request body despite sending valid JSON data.  The solution involves correctly configuring the body-parser middleware to handle JSON requests.  The `bug.js` file demonstrates the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected implementation.
